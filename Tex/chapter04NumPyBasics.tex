\chapter{NumPy Basics: Arrays and Vectorized Computation}
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational packages for numerical computing in Python. 

Here are some of the things youâ€™ll find in NumPy:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities
    \item Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops
    \item Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files
    \item Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities
    \item A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN
\end{itemize}
